# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This project is to demonstrate how to handle a high-dimensional dataset, performing exploratory analyses, using the derived insights to prepare the data, and performing modelling and prediction using statistical models in R Programming.

Procedure:
1. Exploratory data analysis : DATA STRUCTURE AND CLASS BALANCE, MISSING DATA, FEATURE SCALES AND OUTLIERS
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering : TRAIN-TEST SPLIT WITH GROUPED DATA, PROCESSING RECIPE, VERIFY PREPROCESSING TRANSFORMATIONS
3. Modelling : BASELINE MODEL-LOGISTIC REGRESSION, ENHANCED PIPELINE:ADD PCA AND SMOTE, FINAL MODEL WITH HYPERPARAMETER TUNING(RANDOM FOREST)
4. Model assessment : FINAL MODEL EVALUATION ON TEST SET
5. Model deployment
